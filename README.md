## 📋 Overview
Sideband is an early-stage TypeScript application designed for messaging and remote procedure calls (RPC). It uses features like binary frames and timestamps to ensure quick and efficient communication. We also focus on security with acknowledgments (ACKs) to confirm message delivery.
